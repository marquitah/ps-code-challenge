Thank you for taking the time to review my coding challenge results. 

I was successful in the setup of the programs until I got to creating the Rails Application. I received some errors.

Here is what I ran on my terminal at this particular step: rails new myapp -d postgresql

In light of getting this in in a timely manner, I decided to write out some pseudocode for the Rails portion.

Apologies for not fully completing the exercise with the Rails App. I found the process of setting up my machine very refreshing and I actaully enjoyed fighting
with my Mac to figure this out :D
We will continue the fight when my schedule allows and I'll get that Rails App going for future projects.



Postgresql

3. Add a varchar column to the table called category

gospotcheckyaaas=# ALTER TABLE MAQ_TABLE ADD COLUMN category VARCHAR;
ALTER TABLE

4. Create a view with the following columns[provide the view SQL]

post_code: The Post Code
total_places: The number of places in that Post Code
total_chairs: The total number of chairs in that Post Code
chairs_pct: Out of all the chairs at all the Post Codes, what percentage does this Post Code represent (should sum to 100% in the whole view)
place_with_max_chairs: The name of the place with the most chairs in that Post Code -max_chairs: The number of chairs at the place_with_max_chairs

Please also include a brief description of how you verified #4
---I verified by gospotcheckyaaas=# \d+ MAQ_VIEW

gospotcheckyaaas=# CREATE VIEW MAQ_VIEW AS
gospotcheckyaaas-# SELECT *
gospotcheckyaaas-# FROM MAQ_TABLE;

RAILS

5. Write a Rails script to categorize the cafes and write the result to the category according to the rules:[provide the script]

If the Post Code is of the LS1 prefix type:
# of chairs less than 10: category = 'ls1 small'
# of chairs greater than or equal to 10, less than 100: category = 'ls1 medium'
# of chairs greater than or equal to 100: category = 'ls1 large'
If the Post Code is of the LS2 prefix type:
# of chairs below the 50th percentile for ls2: category = 'ls2 small'
# of chairs above the 50th percentile for ls2: category = 'ls2 large'
For Post Code is something else:
category = 'other'



---MY PSEUDOCODE---

CASE WHEN post_code contains LS1 

AND number_of_chairs < 10

THEN category = ‘ls1 small’

WHEN post_code contains LS1

AND number_of_chairs >= 10 AND number_of_chairs < 100

THEN category = ‘ls1 medium’

WHEN post_code contains LS1

AND number_of_chairs >= 100

THEN category = ‘ls1 large’

ELSE category = ‘other’

END



6. Write a custom view to aggregate the categories [provide view SQL AND the results of this view]
category: The category column
total_places: The number of places in that category
total_chairs: The total chairs in that category

I apologize that I cannot show the results of the view.

For this view, the COUNT(*) would be the first column with no column name, since I did not specify. The other three columns would follow and the GROUP BY aggregate
function would group the rows that have the same values into "summary rows".


SELECT COUNT(*), category, total_places, total_chairs
FROM MAQ_VIEW
GROUP BY category, total_places, total_chairs


7. Write a script in rails to:

For this one, I'll be honest, I ran out of steam tonight. I look forward to diving into this one at a later date. If time allows and the final candidates are 
not yet chosen, I would really like to give this one a go for your review.


For street_cafes categorized as small, write a script that exports their data to a csv and deletes the records
For street cafes categorized as medium or large, write a script that concatenates the category name to the beginning of the name and writes it back to the name column
Please share any tests you wrote for #7
